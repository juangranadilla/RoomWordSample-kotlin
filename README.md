# RoomWordSample-kotlin
RoomWordSample app from this [Google Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view) made in Kotlin instead of Java, to practice with some Architecture Components such as [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), [Livedata](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
